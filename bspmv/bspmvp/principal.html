                  <span class="textual">Education plays an important role in the 
                  overall development of the nation. Higher Education is all the 
                  more important in shaping the destiny and standing of the country 
                  at the international level. Higher education should provide 
                  necessary skills and knowledge that prepare and allow all individuals 
                  to become productive members of a knowledge-based society.<br>
                  Education Institute is known by the courses it runs, the teaching 
                  faculty, and the office staff. Ours is one of the oldest institutions 
                  in the town catering to the educational needs since 1969. We 
                  are proud of the fact that most of the students of our college 
                  are from adjoining tribal villages of Melghat and the nearby

                  in the college. We have a very pleasing sight and enough space 
                  and infrastructure to accommodate these activities. We have 
                  spacious lecture-halls, laboratories for Functional English 
                  and Home-Economics, and well built and equipped Computer lab.<br>

                  Post-graduation in Marathi and Home-Economics and Post graduation 
                  in Commerce. Recently, we have started English medium commerce 
                  at Undergraduate level.<br>
                  Observance of strict discipline, dress-code, providing identity 
                  cards in the campus is the integrated part of our institution.
