   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A group of Kunbis in Central India, 1916
Kunbi (alternatively Kanbi) is a generic term applied to castes of traditionally non-elite tillers in Western India These include the Dhonoje, Ghatole, Hindre, Jadav, Jhare, Khaire, Lewa (Leva Patil), Lonare and Tirole communities of Vidharbha The communities are largely found in the state of Maharashtra but also exist in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala and Goa. Kunbis are included among the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in Maharashtra.[5][a][b] </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sant Tukaram, one of the most revered Varkari saints of the Bhakti tradition of Maharashtra belonged to this community, on the other hand Kumar Munshi Kincaid and Parasanisa, consider him to be of the Vani or grocer caste. Most of the Mawalas serving in the armies of the Maratha Empire under Shivaji came from the community. The Shinde and Gaekwad dynasties of the Maratha Empire are originally of Kunbi origin. In the fourteenth century and later, several Kunbis who had taken up employment as military men in the armies of various rulers underwent a process of Sanskritization and began to identify themselves as Marathas. The boundary between the Marathas and the Kunbi became obscure in the early 20th century due to the effects of colonization, and the two groups came to form one block, the Maratha-Kunbi.
Tensions along caste lines between the Kunbi and the Dalit communities were seen in the Khairlanji killings, and the media have reported sporadic instances of violence against Dalits. Other inter-caste issues include the forgery of caste certificates by politicians, mostly in the grey Kunbi-Maratha caste area, to allow them to run for elections from wards reserved for OBC candidates. In April 2005 the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Marathas are not a sub-caste of Kunbis.

<h4>Jadhav</h4>
  
<p>It is not known how the Jadhav came to be known by that name or when and how they were brought under the generic term Kunbi The home districts of the Jadhav Kunbi are Amaravati, Yavatmal and Nagpur. The community is strictly endogamous; consanguinal marriages with maternal cousins are preferred over those with the paternal However, the number of marriages of such nature are low Marriages are arranged. The preferred minimum age is 22 for males and 18 for females, though these ages are increasing as of 2003 Cremation of the dead is the norm, burial being the exception for children and for those who have died of snake bites.Brahmins are employed for naming and marriage ceremonies. Surnames are varied, their origins unknown. They are generally formed from the place of their dwelling, key events in the family past, or a reference to an animate or inanimate object. Among the rural Jadhavs, the traditional caste council has been replaced by the Akhil Bharatiya Jadhav Kunbi Samaj, a registered regional council located in Nagpur which also engages in social work. The rulings of the statutory gram panchayat are followed at the village level Jadhav males are non-vegetarian but the women generally do not eat meat. There are no further subdivisions amongst the Jadhavs.</p>
